CUSTOMER: 
	"There's been a mistake. I bought a dozen cookies, but this box has only eight."

BAKER: 
	"Ah, that is no mistake. You purchased not a <i>exactly</i> dozen cookies, but <i>up to</i> a dozen cookies."
	"Because we are quite busy today, we only had time to give you eight."

CUSTOMER: 
	"Oh. Well since I only recieved eight, can you refund the other four?"

BAKER: 
	"Don't be rediculous. You payed for up to a dozen, and we provided as best we could."
	"Therefore, we gave you exactly what you paid for."
	   
<hr />

CUSTOMER:
	"Excuse me, I payed for a dozen cookies, yet I only count six."
	
BAKER:
	"Ah, according to your receipt, you purchased a dozen 'cokies', not 'cookies'."
	"A 'cokie' with one 'o' is actually one-half of a cookie."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"So you list your prices in 'cokies' which are each one-half of a cookie?"
	"Couldn't you just double the price and use units people understand?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous."

<hr />

CUSTOMER:
	"I recently bought a dozen cookies, but when I opened the box, there were only four!"
	
BAKER:
	"Ah, the problem is the box. The box can only fit a maximum of four cookies."
	"Therefore, we were only able to provide you four."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"But... you provide the boxes. Could you get a bigger box for a full dozen?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. It would be very expensive to replace all our four-cookie boxes."

CUSTOMER:
	"Ok. Then could you instead give me three boxes of cookies?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. It would be very expensive to give each customer so many boxes."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Why did you sell me a dozen cookies if you knew you could only actually give me four?"
	
BAKER:
	"We weren't sure how many would fit, so we offered up to a dozen."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Ok, so can I be refunded for the eight cookies I did not recieve?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. We tried our best to deliver a dozen cookies, as you paid for."
	"The fact that they didn't fit in the box is not our problem."

<hr />

CUSTOMER:
	"I would like a single cookie please."
	
BAKER:
	"Ok. That's $1 for the cookie, and $10 for the box."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Oh, I don't need a box."
	
BAKER:
	"Yes you do, or else the cookie will get cold."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"I'm not concerned. I'm going to eat it now. I don't need a box."
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. Nobody wants to eat a cold cookie." 
	"To ensure you have the best experience possible, you MUST purchase the box. No exceptions."

CUSTOMER:
	"What if I have my own box to keep it warm?"
	
BAKER:
	"That box is incompatable with our cookies."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"... Don't your cookies fit in this box?"
	
BAKER:
	"Yes."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"... Does your box do anything that this box can't do?"
	
BAKER:
	"No."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"So then can't I just use this one?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. I've already told you that box is incompatable with our cookies."
	"If you refuse to purchase a box, I can't sell you this cookie. It's both or neither."
	
<hr />

CUSTOMER:
	"How much for a dozen cookies?"
	
BAKER:
	"$30"
	
CUSTOMER:
	"But... the sign says a dozen cookies are only $8"
	
BAKER:
	"A dozen cookies is $30."
	"Eight cookies is $45."
	"A dozen cookies and a donut is $25."
	"Fourteen cookies is $45."
	"A dozen cookies and a brownie is $30."
	"Sixty cookies is $16."
	"A dozen cookies and eight bricks is $8."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"That doesn't make sense. Why is the same thing cheaper if I get a donut?"
	"And for that matter, can't you give me the dozen cookies and the bricks for $8, and then just keep the bricks?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. It makes perfect sense. Buying a dozen cookies is cheaper with a donut because they are a bundle deal."
	"You can't buy the dozen cookies without the bricks because they too are a bundle deal. You can't break the bundle."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Are the dozen cookies by themselves different from the cookies in the bricks bundle?"
	
BAKER:
	"No."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"And you <i>can</i> just sell the cookies"

BAKER:
	"Yes."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"So you <i>can</i> sell the individual components of the bundles, as though they were bundles, without consequence."
	
BAKER:
	"Yes."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"So can I just have the dozen cookies for $8?"
	
BAKER:
	"..."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"..."
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous."
	
<hr />


CUSTOMER:
	"Excuse me, every week I buy 6 cookies, and it's always $4. Today it was $10."
	"Did your prices change?"
	
BAKER:
	"No."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Then I think I was charged the incorrect amount."
	
BAKER:
	"You were charged correctly. Each time you buy 30 total cookies, the price increases, permanently."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"You didn't tell me the price would change, and nowhere in your store do any signs say the price is different."
	"I want a refund."
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. All our signs says that six cookies <i>starts</i> at $4."
	"The first time you bought cookies, they <i>were</i> $4, so we didn't do anything wrong."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Fine! Then I'm going to buy my cookies from a different bakery!"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. You cannot."

CUSTOMER:
	"Sure I can! I'll just go across the street, and -"
	
BAKER:
	"No no no. You see, I have an agreement with all the other bakers."
	"Based on where you live, you are only permitted to go to a single bakery."
	"For you, that bakery is here. You can't go to other bakeries, they'll refuse service."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"... Then can you at least tell me how much the cookies cost next time?"
	
BAKER:
	"Don't be rediculous. It would take far too much space on our beautiful signs and advertisements to display the actual price."
	"If you want to know how much they'll cost for you, specifically, I can provide an ESTIMATE, but you'll really just have to buy them and see."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"But... you set the price. Surely you know how much you're going to charge before you do so."

BAKER:
	"I can give an ESTIMATE, yes."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"Ok, well in that case, how much do you estimate it will cost the next time I buy 6 cookies?"
	
BAKER:
	"Hmmm...."
	
BAKER:
	"mmmmm..."
	
BAKER:
	"Hmmm mmm....."
	
BAKER:
	"... mmm...."

BAKER:
	"I estimate $4."
	
CUSTOMER:
	"I'd like to buy 6 cookies."
	
BAKER:
	"That'll be $10."
