There I was, running twenty minutes late for work,

and then I remembered I had an important meeting I was going to be late to.

Then, just as I arrived, I realized I forgot my badge.

Doors were locked, so I had to run home and grab it, wasting a bunch of time.

Get halfway <i>back</i>, and BAM! Flat tire!

And... I was about to just give up entirely, I'm on the verge of tears.

And just then...

	The sun blew up
	
	and the rest of it didn't matter very much at all, actually.
